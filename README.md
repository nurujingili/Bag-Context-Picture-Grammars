# Bag-Context-Picture-Grammars Application (BACOPA)
A program to read bag context picture grammar and generate pictures. BACOPA consists of two Python files, the first file named bagcontext.py and the second file named bcgrammar.py. The bagcontext.py file contains all the code for the generation of pictures while the bcgrammar.py file contains the initial bag and grammar rules that are executed by the program. The application can be initialised by loading the file bagcontext.py. Each time you run the program, it creates a .png file of each pictorial form and saves it in the folder where the program is stored. A user can change the folder where they want the pictures to be stored in the bagcontext.py file. Running the grammar several times allows the generation of a variety of images for that grammar. The user may change the grammar as they wish in the bcgrammar.py file and run the program again.
